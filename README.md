Learning progression log from freeCodeCamp's "Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms," "Learn Basic Javascript by Building a Role Playing Game."
Project Description:
    "JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that you can use to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.
    In this practice project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding your own Role Playing Game. You'll learn how to work with arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more."
    There are comments scattered throughout the different files, which are meant to serve as learning points. They are formatted in the way that they are because the text editor window is not full screen, but half. The formatting allows me to read the notes without having to scroll horizontally.
